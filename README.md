# Building a Threadripper...for cheap!

Contains slides from my talk on February 27th, at the [Chicago R User Group Meetup on Hardware for Data Science.](https://github.com/Chicago-R-User-Group/2019-n2-Hardware-for-Data-Science)

- The [`slides`](https://github.com/JustinMShea/hardware-for-data-science/tree/master/slides) folder contains everything to render locally. You can try ti view the slides in html [here](https://rawcdn.githack.com/JustinMShea/hardware-for-data-science/2fecfb8df16ba7bd4776e376614b4aac36982c61/slides/threadripper-build.html), but maybe too big to render.
- Benchmark script, `Machine_Test_Script.R` from Parfait Gasana.
- Link to Parfaits google docs page for submitting benchmarks [here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScgHUzUe2yAYZfeHjA_Tf82mEWhqurGcb9M4yYWRlp8-X1S_Q/viewform)
